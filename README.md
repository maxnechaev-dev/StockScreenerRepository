# StockScreenerRepository

App named "Stock Screener", actually it is screener that can shows you trending stocks for today. If you want, you can save symbols of stocks to favorite (implemented with CoreData). Very basic but comfortable app for people who want to follow their favorites companies. Used Clean Architecture.
